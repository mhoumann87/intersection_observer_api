# Intersection Observers

Playing around with the Intersection Observer API built in in JavaScript.

3 different "effects":

- Menu Change on Scroll
- Item slide in and change opacity on scroll
- Lazy loading of images on scroll

It is based on tutorials on [Kevin Powell's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)

The three branches are for the different effects, and there are also different Javascript files.

The CSS files aren't in the repo, but the SCSS are.
